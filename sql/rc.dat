3; 1; 42; 5; 2017-03-02 18:21:21; Still one of the best meals I've eaten in Rochester. Great staff, very friendly, very accommodating. Really good vibe, beautiful decor.
4; 2; 12; 4; 2017-02-20 08:30:22; I'm a fan of The Vesper! I was sad when Nikko left, but I am glad to see another restaurant make use of its space.
5; 2; 55; 3; 2017-03-05 14:48:46; We were there around 5:30 on a Friday night, hoping for a good happy hour. The place was pretty empty.
6; 2; 117; 5; 2017-02-19 19:33:14; I choose to go The Vesper because it was walking distance from my place and I wanted to try somewheres else aside from my usual, Victorie, Tapas.
7; 3; 91; 5; 2016-12-31 04:55:00; We've heard about the wonders of this place for years and finally had the time to check it out. It was worth the wait. I was amazed at how flavorful every.
8; 3; 109; 4; 2017-03-12 18:30:19; Very unique find in the outskirts of Rochester. Came here when I saw a review of their buffalo cauliflower. I have been wanting to make my own buffalo.
9; 3; 97; 4; 2017-03-09 08:25:24; I joined a couple friends here for dinner a couple weeks back, and have been meaning to add a review, since I don't eat here very often, but I am still.
10; 4; 69; 5; 2016-12-03 21:34:05; I wasn't sure what to expect with Avvino. People told me the location was easy to miss, seemed like nothing special from the outside.
11; 4; 25; 2; 2016-12-30 08:41:42; It pains me to write this review. I was looking so forward to finally coming and enjoying this restaurant for my birthday.
12; 4; 5; 3; 2016-12-02 19:36:40; This is a place you come to for the food. If you are a foodie, welcome to foodie heaven. We opted to share some smaller plates and one entre so that we.
13; 5; 118; 5; 2017-03-11 13:52:06; This is a fairly new restaurant in Rochester and they did not disappoint. They were fairly busy when we went at 6 but had a reservation and were seated.
14; 5; 110; 3; 2017-03-16 19:15:59; Good. Just not great. That's how I can best describe Nosh. The hype for this place had been built up so high by every Rochester food blogger with an...
15; 5; 59; 5; 2017-03-07 18:38:18; Such a great restaurant! We got a reservation and I'm glad we did, it got very busy as the night went on and we would have had to wait for a table if we...
16; 6; 50; 5; 2017-02-26 08:42:38; We came here for brunch and had an excellent meal. The blue crab salad was perfect and the sausage gravy biscuits I am told were 'out if this world'.
17; 6; 17; 5; 2017-02-15 18:37:48; One of my FAVORITE restaurants in all of Rochester! Quirky but intimate and cozy ambiance and quite possibly the BEST steak I have ever had in Rochester.
18; 6; 86; 4; 2017-02-01 09:59:20; I'm embarrassed to say that it took me like 5 minutes to realize that the front door was actually the front door. They have curtains and a table right.
19; 7; 67; 4; 2017-02-04 13:18:36; Tap and Mallet is a cool intimate bar with beers on tap for every pallet, but the main thing I want to talk about is the food. The food was incredible: we...
20; 7; 107; 3; 2017-03-17 06:46:27; This place was a bit confusing depending on what door you came into. There are about 4 different entrances and if you are looking to sit in the dining area.
21; 7; 119; 2; 2017-02-20 16:06:43; Had lunch here last week and the food was quite tasty.  Not the friendliest server. but, hey, it's New York.
22; 8; 114; 5; 2017-03-12 20:08:35; 1.) Best poutine I have ever had! Love their gravy and the touch of a runny egg on top 2.) I would make a reservation. It is not that big and it gets busy.
23; 8; 44; 4; 2017-03-12 17:31:23; YES for Brunch! Really enjoyed our first visit here for brunch. I was impressed with how many options they had for brunch and decided on the Vermonster.
24; 8; 122; 5; 2017-02-24 12:09:59; One of my favorite places to go out for dinner or drinks in Rochester. Good variety of cocktails & all the food is delicious. I think on a previous review I...
25; 9; 62; 5; 2017-02-02 07:53:58; The Best Mediterranean Food, I've Had in 30 Years !!! Highly Recommend the Lamb/Beef Kabobs with Their Fresh Authentic Tzatziki Sauce.
26; 9; 82; 3; 2017-02-19 06:12:40; Until the business gets the mechanics fixed, the stars are dropping down!
27; 9; 3; 3; 2017-02-09 10:22:21; This is the best way I know how to describe this place.  I have been here 3 times now and have to say.... The service and...
28; 10; 60; 5; 2017-02-28 15:37:17; OH MY GOD!! This food is so good and so authentic!
29; 10; 35; 5; 2016-10-31 10:44:33; My second visit to The French Quarter, for dinner this past weekend, cemented my love for this hidden Rochester gem. To sum it up: delicious food, notably...
30; 10; 79; 4; 2016-10-08 14:33:44; Food was quite good and very reasonably priced.  Servers were quite green and weren't that knowledgeable about the menu or drinks.   When one of our party
31; 11; 49; 5; 2017-02-25 21:18:54; I've been here twice so far and will definitely be coming back! I feel like this is the hip version of my friendly Italian grandmas kitchen! 
32; 11; 89; 5; 2017-02-25 15:39:06; We had a delightful experience at Fiorella and they were very accommodating for our plant based (vegan) diet.
33; 11; 92; 5; 2017-01-12 11:10:12; I have completely fallen in love with this cozy Public Market spot. Going on a limb here and saying it is the best homemade pasta I have had in Rochester,...
34; 12; 118; 4; 2017-03-12 10:41:00; Cute place to grab dinner, I had the burger. It was cooked well and was juicy. It came with fries that were crisp and fresh.
35; 12; 17; 2; 2017-02-15 18:33:54; I have always loved The Gate House and was excited to bring my fiancé there for his first visit. Since moving to their new location however, I've come to...
36; 12; 82; 5; 2017-02-02 16:44:53; I can't believe that I haven't reviewed The Gate House since I've been there dozens of time over the years with family and work party's.
37; 13; 102; 5; 2017-03-16 13:56:09; This is definitely a favorite spot of mine in Rochester. I recently ate here for my third time in about a year and "ne'er" time has disappointed me.
38; 13; 50; 5; 2017-02-25 14:12:33; I cannot rave about this place enough. I frequent Tapas 177 with friends, coworkers and sometimes after a long day for a glass of wine. Their wine selection...
39; 13; 39; 5; 2016-12-12 12:28:10; Went here last night for a company Christmas party and had an absolute ball. The food was delicious, the ghouda meatballs and portabello mushroom with cream...
40; 14; 121; 5; 2017-02-06 17:47:36; Curry and Coconut all the things! But seriously, Coco Garden's cuisine is as on-point as these rave reviews about it. I really had no inkling of Malaysian...
41; 14; 10; 3; 2017-02-15 16:15:05; Mango Boba: 1 out of 5 Roti canai: 2 out of 5 Steamed red snapper: 5 out of 5 Coconut rice: 3 out of 5 Service: 3 out of 5 Ambiance: 2 out of 5
42; 14; 101; 4; 2017-01-02 09:36:32; Good authentic Malaysian food in Rochester! The service was good, very friendly staff. The food was hot and homemade and came out really quick too!
43; 15; 52; 5; 2017-01-24 09:41:57; Mmmmhmmmm...we just paid 24 bucks for a dish of fajitas cooked by a dishwasher that was big enough to feed 1 anorexic model. The service was adequate. Our...
44; 15; 22; 3; 2017-03-09 12:05:55; Overall ok experience. The restaurant itself had a very cool atmosphere and seemed like a great spot to go for a couple of drinks after work. 
45; 15; 90; 3; 2016-12-16 05:01:20; It's sad that this place didn't seem to hold on to the yumminess. I first went here with a gf of mine maybe like a year ago and it was great! Like 4-4.5...
46; 16; 111; 4; 2017-02-02 13:38:02; I love the Cub Room.  I live in the apartments upstairs and I try to pop in here as often as I can. Solid bar scene - Consistently delicious cocktails,...
47; 16; 113; 5; 2016-12-10 20:11:12; The Cub Room is a gem and a little piece of Manhattan in the Wedge. I have been here so many times partly because of their great drink selections and...
48; 16; 95; 3; 2016-12-10 09:16:11; I went to the Cub Room with a group for a holiday party. First off, I really like the rustic appearance of this repurposed building. They did a really good...

50; 17; 45; 4; 2017-03-18 13:05:22; An associate and I tried Cedar for lunch this week.  It seems that, while I like Mediterranean, I've never had good luck with Lebanese!  The losing-Lebanese...

56; 19; 65; 3; 2017-03-18 15:11:38; We got the Korean fried chicken (with gochujang sauce). It was too salty and sweet. I miss you, Bonchon! We also got the ramen. The noodles were too soft...
57; 19; 48; 2; 2017-02-11 20:37:14; I gave butapub a second chance before writing this review. The main reason for such a low rating is because of the service. The first time I was here, it...
58; 20; 21; 5; 2017-01-07 17:29:36; Legit northern chinese food, real good taste, personally recommend the pot, it's pretty nice
59; 20; 6; 4; 2016-12-11 09:20:03; Very authentic Chinese food. The flavors are very natural and taste like home cooked Chinese food.

63; 21; 118; 5; 2017-03-12 10:43:16; Great BBQ place, they have great sides as well. The mac and cheese is one of my favorites. They have lots of options and combos to choose from.

65; 22; 32; 4; 2016-09-26 16:17:06; Had the deluxe sashimi plate.  Over all it was fair quality fish, defiantly wasn't impressed with the fish. The presentation was well done and the cost...
