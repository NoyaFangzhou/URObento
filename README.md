# Functionality

This is the website designed to serve all UR students, even all citizens in City of Rochester. We'd like to provide an Online delivery platfor. People who want to order some meal at their home or office. If you can only order it by making a phone call. It cannot give you the direct opinion about the food unless you have been there personally. But with our website, people can see the picture and the gradients in the food and they also see the rates of the food and other customersâ€™ commends. So it would give them more options. All they need to do is click on the buttons on the website, the restaurant will receive the order information. After the customers received the order, she/ he can rate it on the website. The restaurant owner also can manage the menu information online.

This website provides three kind of user access

### Customer:

Customers can find restaurants around the rochester city, ordered by the distance. Each restaurant has its own information, like address, phone number, score and some recommended dishes.

When clicked in the restaurant, one can see all available dishes with price, recommended level and its images. For ordering, user can select the dishes and add some extra requirement if they want.

### Restaurant Owner:

Restaurant Owners can manage their own restaurant. For example, they can add/delete dishes into the menu, alter the price, or see all the orders they have. Also, they can see all the orders or socres that each user gave after serving. 

### Website Admin:

Admin take the responsibility of managing the entire website. One can delete the restaurant from the database due to some reason like bad reputation, safty problem...
