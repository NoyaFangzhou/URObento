# Functionality

This is the website designed to serve all UR students, even all citizens in City of Rochester. We'd like to provide an Online delivery platform for all people so that they don't have to spend time searching for restaurant's phone numbers when they want to order an delivery service.

This website provides three kind of user access

### Customer:

Customers can find restaurants around the rochester city, ordered by the distance. Each restaurant has its own information, like address, phone number, score and some recommended dishes.

When clicked in the restaurant, one can see all available dishes with price, recommended level and its images. For ordering, user can select the dishes and add some extra requirement if they want.

### Restaurant Owner:

Restaurant Owners can manage their own restaurant. For example, they can add/delete dishes into the menu, alter the price, or see all the orders they have. Also, they can see all the orders or socres that each user gave after serving. 

### Website Admin:

Admin take the responsibility of managing the entire website. One can delete the restaurant from the database due to some reason like bad reputation, safty problem...

# Technology

We plan to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax as our front-end and use PHP to deal with all data operations relevant to SQL database. RESTful API should also be applied.
